Historically, falls are the leading cause of fatalities in construction, accounting for about one-third of all fatalities in the industry. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that there were 291 fatal falls to a lower level in construction in 2013, out of 828 total fatalities. OSHA recognizes that incidents involving falls are generally complex events, frequently involving a variety of factors."

    "chunk_text": "Protecting Construction Workers in Confined Spaces 1 7\n=== Page 24 ===\nCHAPTER 6 Content of Permit Space Program (Sections 1204-1206) The permit space program must establish a system for preparing, using, and canceling entry permits, which are written or printed documents that allow and control entry into permit spaces. A permit space program must: ■ Implement measures to prevent unauthorized entry; ■ Identify and evaluate permit space hazards before allowing employee entry; ■ Provide for the atmospheric conditions in the permit space to be tested before entry operations and for the space to be monitored during entry; ■ Require appropriate testing for the following atmospheric hazards in this sequence: oxygen, combustible gases or vapors, and toxic gases or vapors; ■ Establish and implement the means, procedures and practices to eliminate or control hazards necessary for safe permit space entry operations; ■ Identify employee job duties; ■ Provide and maintain, at no cost to the employee, personal protective equipment and any other equipment necessary for safe entry, and require employees to use the equipment properly; ■ Ensure that at least one attendant is stationed outside the permit space during entry operations; ■ Implement the procedures that any attendant who is required to monitor multiple spaces will follow during an emergency in one or more of those spaces; ■ Coordinate entry operations (in consultation with the controlling contractor) when employees of more than one employer are working in the permit space; and Occupational Safety and Health Administration 1 8\n=== Page 25 ===\n■ Establish procedures for summoning rescue and emergency services and preventing unauthorized personnel from attempting rescue. The employer must review the program and correct any deficiencies whenever it learns that the program may not be protecting employees adequately. Circumstances requiring such review include an injury or near-miss during entry, unauthorized entry, detection of a new hazard or a condition prohibited by the permit, or an employee complaint about the program’s effectiveness."

    "chunk_text": "Sewer entry differs in three vital respects from other permit entries; first, there rarely exists any way to completely isolate the space (a section of a continuous system) to be entered; second, because isolation of the space is not complete, the atmosphere may suddenly and unpredictably become lethally hazardous (toxic, flammable or explosive) from causes beyond the control of the entrant or employer; and third, material flowing through the sewer system may engulf entrants. However, experienced sewer workers are especially knowledgeable about entry and work in their permit spaces because of their frequent entries. Unlike other employments where permit space entry is a rare and exceptional event, sewer workers’ usual work environment is a permit space. OSHA believes that if employers reinforce and follow the four procedures below that the risks of sewer work can be controlled and employees protected from the many unpredictable hazards of sewers."

    "chunk_text": "How does water affect the flow of electricity? Pure water is a poor conductor. But small amounts of impurities in water like salt, acid, solvents, or other materials can turn water itself and substances that generally act as insulators into conductors or better conductors. Dry wood, for example, generally slows or stops the flow of electricity. But when saturated with water, wood turns into a conductor. The same is true of human skin. Dry skin has a fairly high resistance to electric current. But when skin is moist or wet, it acts as a conductor."

Grantees are also expected to follow up with people who have been trained to find out what changes were made to reduce the hazards in their workplaces as a result of the training. Each year OSHA has a national competition that is announced in the Federal Register and on the Internet at www.osha.gov/dte/sharwood/index.html.

OSHA estimates that 30 of those deaths as well as nearly 1,150 annu- al lost-workday injuries can be averted by com- pliance with provisions of the Steel Erection standard, developed with industry and labor through negotiated rulemaking.To that end, this eTool has been created to educate employers and workers."

    "chunk_text": "The partnership had three goals: • All contractors have an effective safety and health program; • All hazards corrected daily after daily audits are conducted; and • Increase the level of training for supervisors and employees. The work was more hazardous than typical steel erections because stadiums are curved and angular in shape. Also, construction and demoli- tion activities were taking place simultaneously, often within a few feet of each other. Several potential serious accidents were avoid- ed by requiring all contractors’ safety and health programs to establish a requirement of 100 per- cent fall protection at or above six feet."
